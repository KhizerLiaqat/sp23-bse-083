In my Semester 2 project, I crafted a perfect shopping cart checkout page for the e-commerce website "The Note." This form ensures smooth validation for users during the checkout process, focusing on user-friendly design and essential validation checks for inputs like card information, shipping details, and contact info. The goal of the project was to create a seamless, intuitive experience for customers while maintaining strict validation standards for accuracy and security.
